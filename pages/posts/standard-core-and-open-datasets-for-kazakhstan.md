# Standard, Core and Open Datasets for Kazakhstan

With a pandemic in 2020 we have been locked in our homes for a lot of time and it turned out I need to do something on my Sunday mornings. One idea was to wrangle some basic and useful datasets related to my region since no such data existed in [a standard and open format](https://5stardata.info/en/). I have started a Sunday project for wrangling useful datasets that are related to Kazakhstan region and created a [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/open-data-kazakhstan) for it.
